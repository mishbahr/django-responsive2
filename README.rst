django-responsive2 is an experimental Django app that gives web designers tools for building
responsive websites. It can dynamically swap content based on breakpoints. Tested on Django>=1.8.

Why would you use django-responsive2?
-------------------------------------

This project was inspired by Twitter Bootstrap's `Responsive Utilities <http://getbootstrap.com/css/#responsive-utilities>`_. Bootstrap provides some handful helper classes, for faster mobile-friendly development. These
can be used for showing and hiding content by device via media query combined with large, small,
and medium devices.

Similarly ``django-responsive2`` can be used to render different content based on device screen sizes and pixel ratios.
However, while it is very useful to show/hide content using css display property, Bootstrap Responsive Utilities does not actually prevent the content from being loaded on to the page. It is best explained through examples.


**Sample example template using django-responsive2**:

.. code-block:: html+django

    <div class="container">
        <div class="row">
            {% if device.is_xsmall or device.is_small %}
                <div class="col-sm">
                    {# Rendered for x-small/small screen devices #}
                    <img src="images/myimage_sm.jpg" alt="Descriptive alt tag" />
                </div>
            {% elif device.is_medium %}
                <div class="col-md">
                    {# Rendered for medium screen devices #}
                    <img src="images/myimage_md.jpg" alt="Descriptive alt tag" />
                </div>
            {% else %}
                <div class="col-lg">
                    {# Rendered for large/xlarge screen devices #}
                    <img src="images/myimage_lg.jpg" alt="Descriptive alt tag" />
                </div>
            {% endif %}
        </div>
    </div>

In this very simple example, using the Bootstrap Responsive Utilities, all 3 images would have been loaded on to the page, wasting precious bandwidth, together with increase in page load time.

In comparison, using ``django-responsive2``, only ``col-sm`` will be rendered for small screen devices (e.g. an iPhone), ``col-m`` will be displayed for medium screen devices (e.g. an iPad) and lastly ``col-lg`` will be visible for large screen devices or any devices that do not match the rules for small/medium devices.


Using django-responsive2 in your views
--------------------------------------

You can also use the ``django-responsive2`` in your Django views to do particular things based on the matched media queries for the visitors device.

The ``ResponsiveMiddleware`` middleware sets the ``device`` attribute on every request object, so you can use ``request.device`` to get the device information for your visitors:

.. code-block:: python

	MIDDLEWARE = (
	    ...
	    'responsive.middleware.ResponsiveMiddleware'
	    ...
	)

Here’s an (verbose) example of what the a view could look like, ``request.device.matched`` returns a list of matched media queries for the visitors device.

e.g. ``['small', 'retina']`` :

.. code-block:: python

    def home(request):

        if 'retina' in request.device.matched:
            thumbnail_high_resolution = True
        else:
            thumbnail_high_resolution = False

        if request.device.is_small:
            hide_ads = True
        else:
            hide_ads = False

        ...
        context = {
            'thumbnail_high_resolution': thumbnail_high_resolution,
            'hide_ads': hide_ads
        }

        ...

Quickstart
----------

1. Install django-responsive2:

   .. code-block:: bash

    pip install django-responsive2

2. Add ``responsive`` to ``INSTALLED_APPS``:

   .. code-block:: python

    INSTALLED_APPS = (
        ...
        'responsive',
        ...
    )

3. Add ``django.core.context_processors.request``  and ``responsive.context_processors.device`` to your ``TEMPLATE_CONTEXT_PROCESSORS``:

   .. code-block:: python

    TEMPLATES = [
	    {
	        ...
	        'OPTIONS': {
	            'context_processors': [
	                ...
	                'django.template.context_processors.request',
	                'responsive.context_processors.device',
	                ...
	            ],
	        },
	    },
	]

4. Add the ``ResponsiveMiddleware`` to MIDDLEWARE_CLASSES:

   .. code-block:: python

    MIDDLEWARE = (
        ...
        'responsive.middleware.ResponsiveMiddleware',
        ...
    )



Configuration
-------------
``django-responsive2`` lets you to define the breakpoints at which your layout will change,
adapting to different screen sizes.  Here's the default breakpoints:

.. code-block:: python

    RESPONSIVE_MEDIA_QUERIES = {
        'small': {
            'verbose_name': _('Small screens'),
            'min_width': None,
            'max_width': 640,
        },
        'medium': {
            'verbose_name': _('Medium screens'),
            'min_width': 641,
            'max_width': 1024,
        },
        'large': {
            'verbose_name': _('Large screens'),
            'min_width': 1025,
            'max_width': 1440,
        },
        'xlarge': {
            'verbose_name': _('XLarge screens'),
            'min_width': 1441,
            'max_width': 1920,
        },
        'xxlarge': {
            'verbose_name': _('XXLarge screens'),
            'min_width': 1921,
            'max_width': None,
        }
    }

** Borrowed from ZURB Foundation framework, see http://foundation.zurb.com/docs/media-queries.html

While there are several different items we can query on, the ones used for django-responsive2
are min-width, max-width, min-height and max-height.

* min_width — Rules applied for any device width over the value defined in the config.
* max_width — Rules applied for any device width under the value defined in the config.
* min_height — Rules applied for any device height over the value defined in the config.
* max_height — Rules applied for any device height under the value defined in the config.
* pixel_ratio — Rules applied for any device with devicePixelRatio defined in the config.

You can override the default media queries by defining own in your ``RESPONSIVE_MEDIA_QUERIES``
in your ``settings.py``. For example:

.. code-block:: python

    RESPONSIVE_MEDIA_QUERIES = {
        'iphone': {
            'verbose_name': _('iPhone Retina'),
            'min_width': 320,   # mobile first queries
            'pixel_ratio': 2
        },
        ...
    }

For every media queries, the  ``device`` object will have a ``is_FOO`` attribute, where FOO
is the name of the media query. This attribute returns ``True/False``.

Continuing with the example ``RESPONSIVE_MEDIA_QUERIES`` settings above, here’s a simple corresponding template:

.. code-block:: html+django

    <div class="container">
        <div class="row">
            {% if device.is_iphone %}
                {# this snippet will only be rendered for retina devices with minimum device width 320 #}
                <div class="app-store">
                    <a href="#">Available on the App Store</a>
                </div>
            {% endif %}
        </div>
    </div>

This app started as a clone of ``django-responsive`` with some minor modifications to fit my own project requirements. So a big thank you to `@mlavin <https://github.com/mlavin>`_ for his hard work.

Shout out to `@jezdez <https://github.com/jezdez>`_ for the awesome ``django-appconf`` — used by this project to handle default configurations.
